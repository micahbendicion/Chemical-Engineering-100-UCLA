# Chemical-Engineering-100-UCLA

Welcome to CH ENGR 100 at UCLA, I will upload all of mine discussion notes in the form of Jupyter Notebook. 
Feel free to play around with the code by downloading or forking this repo.
Each discussion notes will have a compiled version to quickly look at and a jupyter notebook version which you can play around with.
